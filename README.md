# Pathing Maze

A full stack angularJS project that can solve a text based maze. It accepts the raw maze and submits it to the backend that parses through and provides a solution that the dom then renders with the shortest path and the number of steps required to reach the end.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installing

After pulling from github, install the files with npm 
```
npm install
```
This will take care of dependencies and allow you to get the project running by using the start command
```
npm start
```
The project will run on localhost 5000. You can then submit the following maze to test the project and solving algorithm
```
